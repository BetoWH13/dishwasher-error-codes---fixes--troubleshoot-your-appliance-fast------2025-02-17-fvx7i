                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1Ô∏è‚É£ Where to Find the Model Number on Your Dishwasher</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Every dishwasher has a model number label, but its location depends on the manufacturer. Here are the most common spots to check:</p>
                <ul class="list-none space-y-3 mb-6">
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-green-500 mr-2">‚úÖ</span>
                        <span><strong>Inside the Door Frame</strong> ‚Äì Open the dishwasher door and look along the edges or on the top side. Manufacturers often place the label here because it is protected from moisture and wear.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-green-500 mr-2">‚úÖ</span>
                        <span><strong>On the Side of the Tub</strong> ‚Äì Some models place the sticker on the interior wall of the tub. Be sure to check both sides, as it may be positioned in a less obvious spot.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-green-500 mr-2">‚úÖ</span>
                        <span><strong>Behind the Kick Plate</strong> ‚Äì Remove the lower panel at the bottom of the dishwasher to check behind it. This location is more common in older models, where manufacturers placed the information in an area that wouldn't wear down quickly.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-green-500 mr-2">‚úÖ</span>
                        <span><strong>On the Control Panel or Door Edge</strong> ‚Äì Certain models have the model number near the buttons or display, especially on dishwashers with a front-facing control panel.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-green-500 mr-2">‚úÖ</span>
                        <span><strong>Owner's Manual or Purchase Receipt</strong> ‚Äì If you still have the paperwork, the model number is often listed there. Keeping your user manual or a digital copy of your purchase receipt is helpful for future reference.</span>
                    </li>
